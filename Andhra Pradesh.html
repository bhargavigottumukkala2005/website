            Lepakshi is a small village located in the Anantapur district of Andhra Pradesh, India, renowned for its rich cultural heritage and architectural marvels. The village is best known for the Veerabhadra Temple, an ancient temple dedicated to Lord Shiva in the form of Veerabhadra, a fierce deity in Hindu mythology. Constructed during the Vijayanagara Empire in the 16th century, the temple is a splendid example of Vijayanagara architecture, characterized by intricate carvings, exquisite sculptures, and detailed friezes depicting mythological stories and scenes from Hindu epics like the Ramayana and Mahabharata.

            One of the most striking features of the Veerabhadra Temple is its massive monolithic Nandi (bull), which is carved out of a single granite rock and stands at the entrance of the temple complex. The temple also houses a unique hanging pillar, which is believed to be unsupported and hangs from the ceiling. Lepakshi is also famous for its ceiling paintings, which depict various mythological and historical themes with vibrant colors and intricate details.
